# Muslamic Makers - Introduction to Python

This repository contains a single jupyter notebook which acts as a very basic intro to Python for programme members. The material is based on the Python for Data Analysis book by Wes Mckinney and that text should be consulted for full details. 

I would focus on the following chapters:
* Chapter 1: All of it
* Chapter 2: 2.1, 2,3
* Chapter 4: 4.1
* Chapter 5: 5.1 - 5.4
* Chapter 6 - 6.1

Finally, to supercharge one's Python game, they will need to be good to Pandas and how to plot data, the best basic coverage is found [here](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). Focus on the following chapters:
* Chapter 3 (all sections)
* Chapter 4 (all sections)

# Prerequisites

Before we can look at Python there will need to be some setup to make things easier. The main things a beginner will need to learn and do is:

1. Learn Command Line basics
2. Download and Install Python. (Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
3. Download and Install an Integrated Development Environment - VSCode is recommended (Download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))
4. Learn to use Git and Github (Optional)
5. Learn to use Python virtual environments (Optional)

Links for how to get started with the above are in the [Muslamic Makers Learning Document.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/MM-Learning-Resources--BYfMWm5fXx3tiN6XIPGIyYypAg-NcazpRWv7cS5jqCGdVAif)
