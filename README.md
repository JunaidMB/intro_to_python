# Muslamic Makers Kickstarter Programme - Introduction to Python

This repository contains a single jupyter notebook which acts as a very basic intro to Python for programme members. The material is based on the Python for Data Analysis book by Wes Mckinney and that text should be consulted for full details. 

I would focus on the following chapters:
* Chapter 1: All of it
* Chapter 2: 2.1, 2,3
* Chapter 4: 4.1
* Chapter 5: 5.1 - 5.4
* Chapter 6 - 6.1

Finally, to supercharge one's Python game, they will need to be good to Pandas and how to plot data, the best basic coverage is found [here](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). Focus on the following chapters:
* Chapter 3 (all sections)
* Chapter 4 (all sections)
